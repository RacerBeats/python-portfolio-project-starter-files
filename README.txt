Codecademy Portfolio Project #1: Planning my first data scrape with proprietary data

goals: use my python fundamentals to read a CSV, extrapolate its data, and communicate
findings within.

Categories:

Age (int)

Sex (Str)

BMI (float)

# of Children (int)

smoker (str, could be bool)

region (str)

charges = how much they pay, probably (float)

Guide to find meaningful info: https://datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/data-science-project-scoping-guide/

Things to analyze:

average age

sex count

bmi avg

# kids avg

smoker status count

region (unique) count

avg charges of health insurance

**SOME MORE THOROUGH STUDIES**
    Avg cost of smokers vs non smokers
    avg age and cost of those with and without kids
